var myName = 'Vamshi'
var -> variable(key)
myName -> Name of the variable
'Vamshi' -> Value

Rules :
->The first  character  must be a letter or an underscore or an dollar, we cant use a number as teh first character.
->We cant use spaces ans other characters.
->variable names are case sensitive.
->There  is no limit for the variable name.
->We cant use js reserved words, like var,const etc.

Data Types in javascript:
->Undefined
->Boolean
->Number
->String
->BigInt
->Symbol

Difference b/w Null and Undefined
->Null : Here we will define a variable and aasssign null as a value.  There is no use of it.

->undefined : Here we define a variable, but we dont assign any value.

What is NaN?
->If we try to subtract two strings ,it shows its Nan-not a number
->isNaN (not a number) is a method used to whether the given input is number or not.

//Expressions And operators

->In 5+7 , 5 and 7 are operands and + is operator and -,*,/,% are also operators.
->Combination of operand and operator is know as "Expression"

Six Types Of Operators :
->Assignment Operators
->Arthmetic Operators
->Comparison Operators
->Logical Operators
->String Operators
->Conditional(Ternary) Operators

1.Assignment Operators: An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand, based on thevalue of its right operand.
The simple assignment operator is equalto (=)

2.Arthmetic Operators : An arithmetic operator takes numerical values, (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

//Increament operators: x++ or ++x 
    Postfix(x++):The postfix operator increaments and returns the value after increamenting
    Prefix(++x):The prefix operator increaments and returns the value before increamenting

//Decreament operators: x-- or --x
    Postfix(X--):The postfix oparator decreaments and returns the value after decreamenting
    Prefix(--X):the prefix oparator decreaments and returns the value before decreamenting

3.Comparison operators:
    (<,>,=,!=,>=,<=) this oparator compares the operands and returns a logical value based on the comparision is true 

4.Logical operators:
    (and , or, not)logical operators are used with Boolean value and returns Boolean values.
    
    (&&)=operand is true if all the operands are true, otherwise its false.

    or(||) = Oparand is true if one or more of its operands are true.
    
    not(!) = takes true and returns false and viseversa 


5.String operators:
    The concatenation oparator(+), concatenates two strings and returns the union of two strings

7.Exponential operators:
     ex=3**5, output will be 3x3x3x3x3

//Difference between == and ===  
    '==' : it only checks the value
    '===' : it checks value and datatype of the value












































    /////////////////////////////////////////////

//Control statements & Loops

1.If Else:
    The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is true or false, if the condition is false,another statement will be executed.
  
//We have 5 falsy values in java script
-> 0, "", undefined, null, NaN, false

2.Switch Statement: 

//Break Tag
    ->If the condition is fulfilled ,then it terminates the switch case.
    ->It terminnaes the current loop, switch, or label statements and transfers, the program control to the statement following the terminated statement.

3.While Loops:
    The while statements creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the condition evaluates to true.
    ->In while loop 1st it checks the condition and then gives the output.

//Block scope
    It gives output when the condition is fulfilled, if the condition is not fulfilled it stops there itself and no ooutput is given.

4.Do-While lop:
    In Do while loop 1st it gives output and then checks the condition.

5.For loop :


6.For In Loop:
7.For Of Loop:
8.Conditional (Ternary) operator:
    It is the only operator that takes three operands 

////////////////////////////////////////////////

//Fuctions in java script

->A javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

->Before we use a function, we have to define it.we have to write Fuction before declaring it.
Syntax : 
    function functionName(){
    //Statement
    }

//Calling Functions :
->Defining a function does not execute it, a javascript function is executed when "something" invokes  it (Calls it)

//Function parameters VS Function Arguments
->Function parameters are the names listed in the functions defination.These are written in parenthesis while defining a function
->Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.These are written in parenthesis while Calling back a function.

//Why functions???
->Once u define the code, u can use it as many times as u want ,we can use the same code many times with different arguments to produce different results

//Fuction Expressions
->Fuction expression simply means, creating a function and put it into the variable.
