//values and variables
rule 1 : while declaring variable the first character should be a letter or underscore or $. 
-> : we cant use js reserved words.
-> : spaces shoud not be used.
-> : variables are case sensitive.

//Data types
6 types of data types:
1.Undefined === "undefined"
2.Boolean === "boolean"
3.Number === "number"
4.String === "string"
5.BigInt === "bigint"
6.Symbol === "symbol"

//Expressions and operators
->isNaN (not a number) is a method used to whether the given input is number or not

->In 5+20 , 5 and 20 are operands and + is operator and -,*,/,% are also operators.

->Types of perators
1.Assignment operators:
    An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand, based on thevalue of its right operand.
    The simple assignment operator is equalt (=)
    
2.Arthmetic operators:
    An arithmetic operator takes numerical values
    (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

3.Comparison operators:
    (<,>,=,!=,>=,<=) this oparator compares the operands and returns a logical value based on the comparision is true 

4.Logical operators:
    (and , or, not)logical operators are used with Boolean value and returns Boolean values and(&&)= if all the operands are true otherwise its false
    or(||) = Oparand is true if one or more of its operands are true .
    not(!) = takes true and returns false and viseversa 

5.String operators:
    The concatenation oparator(+), concatenates two strings and returns the union of two strings

6.Conditional operators

7.Exponential operators:
     ex=3**5, output will be 3x3x3x3x3

//Increament operators: x++ or ++x 
    Postfix(x++):The postfix operator increaments and returns the value after increamenting
    Prefix(++x):The prefix operator increaments and returns the value before increamenting

//Decreament operators: x-- or --x
    Postfix(X--):The postfix oparator decreaments and returns the value after decreamenting
    Prefix(--X):the prefix oparator decreaments and returns the value before decreamenting

//Difference between == and ===  
    '==' : it only checks the value
    '===' : it checks value and datatype of the value

/////////////////////////////////////////////

//Control statements & Loops

1.If Else:
    The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is true or false, if the condition is false,another statement will be executed.
  
//We have 5 falsy values in java script
-> 0, "", undefined, null, NaN, false

2.Switch Statement: 

//Break Tag
    ->If the condition is fulfilled ,then it terminates the switch case.
    ->It terminnaes the current loop, switch, or label statements and transfers, the program control to the statement following the terminated statement.

3.While Loops:
    The while statements creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the condition evaluates to true.
    ->In while loop 1st it checks the condition and then gives the output.

//Block scope
    It gives output when the condition is fulfilled, if the condition is not fulfilled it stops there itself and no ooutput is given.

4.Do-While lop:
    In Do while loop 1st it gives output and then checks the condition.

5.For loop :


6.For In Loop:
7.For Of Loop:
8.Conditional (Ternary) operator:
    It is the only operator that takes three operands
